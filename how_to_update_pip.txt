1.) Activate virtual environment / make sure you are running Python 3x

    source venv/bin/activate

2.) Remove contents of dist/ directory

    rm dist/*

3.) Update package version in setup.py

4.) Run the setup script to generate new distribution artifacts:

    python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

5.) Upload to test.pypi.org

    twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

6.) If the virtual environment is active, deactivate it before installing / upgrading the package from Pypi (otherwise it will be added to the virtual environment)

    deactivate
    
7.) Install from Test PyPi

    pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ looking-glass --upgrade

8.) Upload to pypi.org

    twine upload dist/*

9.) Install from PyPi

    pip3 install looking-glass --upgrade

# Note: files will be installed somewhere like /usr/local/lib/pythonX/dist-packages/looking_glass/application.py
#       can run script using that full path (without putting 'python' in front of it; can also setup an alias for it)
